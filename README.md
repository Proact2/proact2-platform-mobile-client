## Proact 2 Description
In developing a new medication, excellence in both clinical delivery and the understanding of the patient's tolerability are required to deliver optimal treatment. However, in early clinical studies it is difficult for patients to contribute directly to the understanding of a new compound. Patient Reported Opinions About Clinical Tolerability (PROACT 2.0) provides a new, simple and innovative way in which patients can collaborate.			
Patients enrolled will be required to have their own mobile device and consent to taking part. Patients will use the PROACT 2.0 platform to upload video messages that will become instantly available to their clinical team. The team can reply to the patient directly from within the PROACT 2.0 platform. After a mandatory delay period, the patientâ€™s video is analysed and personally-identifiable information is removed. The information is then made available to the sponsor in an analytics module for manual classification using controlled vocabularies and subsequent export to a dedicated offline platform for further analysis and decision-making.
